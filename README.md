## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a B.Tech student specializing in **Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning**, focused on building strong programming fundamentals through structured, project-driven learning.

My current emphasis is on writing clean, modular Python code and developing a solid understanding of system design principles. Over time, I aim to transition into **Machine Learning systems and deployment workflows (MLOps)**.

I approach learning with consistency, discipline, and long-term skill development in mind.

## 🧪 Python Projects

The following projects from my `Python-projects` repository demonstrate practical application of core programming concepts:

### 1. Expense Tracker
CLI-based application for recording and monitoring daily expenses.  
Implements structured input handling and basic data tracking logic.

### 2. Indian General Store Bill Generator
Billing system to calculate total purchase amounts.  
Applies conditional logic, formatted output, and arithmetic operations.

### 3. Student Result Management System
Search-based system for tracking student marks and academic details.  
Utilizes dictionaries and logical filtering for record management.

### 4. Phone Directory
Contact management system built using Python dictionaries.  
Supports add, search, and manage operations.

### 5. Employee Database
Employee salary management system using lists of dictionaries.  
Demonstrates structured data storage and record manipulation.

### 6. Snake–Water–Gun Game
Menu-driven terminal game using the `random` module and conditional logic.  
Reinforces control flow and user interaction handling.
